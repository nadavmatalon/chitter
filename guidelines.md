<h3>Task:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>We are going to write a little Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>In order to use chitter as a maker I want to sign up to the service</li>
			<li>In order to user chitter as a maker I want to log in</li>
			<li>In order to avoid others to use my account as a maker I want to log out</li>
			<li>In order to let people know what I am doing as a maker I want to post a message to chitter</li>
			<li>In order to see what people have to say as a maker I want to see all peeps in chronological order</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Notes:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name</li>
			<li>The username and email are unique</li>
			<li>Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle</li>
			<li>Use bcrypt to secure the passwords</li>
			<li>Use data mapper and postgres to save the data</li>
			<li>You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps</li>
			<li>You only can peep if you are logged in</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
